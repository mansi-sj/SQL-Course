/*What are Foreign Keys?
 A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key of another table.
 It creates a relationship between the two tables.*/

/*Delete Cascade
A delete cascade means that when a record in the parent table
(the table with the primary key) is deleted, all corresponding records
in the child table (the table with the foreign key) will also be deleted
automatically.*/

/*Update Cascade
An update cascade means that when the primary key of a record in the
parent table is updated, all corresponding foreign keys in the child
table will also be updated automatically.*/

/*
In MySQL, you can add and drop constraints on existing tables using the ALTER TABLE statement.

Adding Constraints

1. Adding a Foreign Key Constraint: 
You can add a foreign key constraint to an existing table to enforce referential integrity.

2. Adding a Unique Constraint: 
You can add a unique constraint to ensure that all values in a column are different.

3. Adding a Check Constraint: 
You can add a check constraint to enforce a condition on the values in a column.


Dropping Constraints

1. Dropping a Foreign Key Constraint: 
You can drop a foreign key constraint if you no longer need it.

3. Dropping a Unique Constraint: 
You can drop a unique constraint if you want to allow duplicate values in a column.

4. Dropping a Check Constraint: 
You can drop a check constraint if you want to remove the condition on a column.

What Are Operators in MySQL?

Operators in MySQL are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on one or more operands 
(values, expressions, or fields) in a MySQL query. They are essential for forming conditions, manipulating data, '
and retrieving desired results from the database. Operators help in computations, comparisons, logical evaluations,
string concatenations, and much more.


1. Arithmetic Operators

+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Modulus (remainder after division)
DIV: Integer division (returns integer part of division)
MOD: Modulus (same as % in MySQL)


2. Comparison Operators

=: Equal to
<> or !=: Not equal to
>: Greater than
<: Less than
>=: Greater than or equal to
<=: Less than or equal to
LIKE: Pattern matching using wildcards (% and _)
NOT LIKE: Pattern not matching
REGEXP: Regular expression matching
NOT REGEXP: Regular expression not matching


3. Logical Operators

AND: Logical AND (true if both conditions are true)
OR: Logical OR (true if at least one condition is true)
NOT: Logical NOT (negates the condition)
XOR: Logical exclusive OR (true if only one condition is true)


4. Assignment Operators

=: Assign a value to a variable or column
:=: Assign a value to a user-defined variable
+=: Addition assignment (not standard in MySQL but used in some cases)
-=: Subtraction assignment
*=: Multiplication assignment
/=: Division assignment
%=: Modulus assignment
DIV=: Integer division assignment
MOD=: Modulus assignment


5. Bitwise Operators

&: Bitwise AND
|: Bitwise OR
^: Bitwise XOR
~: Bitwise NOT (inverts the bits)
<<: Left shift
>>: Right shift


6. String Operators

CONCAT(): Concatenate strings (e.g., CONCAT('Hello', ' World'))
||: String concatenation (alternative to CONCAT in some MySQL versions)


7. Other Operators

IN: Membership test (checks if a value exists in a list or subquery)
NOT IN: Membership test (checks if a value does not exist in a list or subquery)
BETWEEN: Range test (checks if a value is within a range)
NOT BETWEEN: Range test (checks if a value is outside a range)
IS NULL: Null test (checks if a value is NULL)
IS NOT NULL: Null test (checks if a value is not NULL)
EXISTS: Subquery test (true if subquery returns any rows)
NOT EXISTS: Subquery test (true if subquery returns no rows)


Why Are Operators Important in MySQL?
Simplify Query Logic: Operators make it easy to specify conditions and manipulate data directly in SQL statements.
Dynamic Data Retrieval: Help fetch specific records based on comparisons and logical conditions.
Data Manipulation: Arithmetic and string operators allow dynamic computation and formatting of data.
Efficient Filtering: Operators like LIKE and BETWEEN enable precise filtering for large datasets.


These operators cover a wide range of functionality, from basic arithmetic to advanced logical and 
string manipulations, enabling efficient data handling and querying in MySQL.
